\begin{abstract}
% Summary:
% - nodes were on time (ahead!)
% - accuracy and precision of the mesaurements
% - followed file formats
\end{abstract}

\section{Data}
% Who submitted data (in what chronological order) for what setups
% How many nodes? How many stars? How many stars analysed by each node in total? (as table)
% Plots of data compared against each node

% comments on GES data format

% Comments on individual nodes

% TECH flags, limited regimes

\section{Model}
% Describe covariance model with outlier treatment

% emphasis on all nodes contribute information!

\section{Results}
% Inferred model uncertainties

% Benchmarks: no cross-validation

% Benchmarks: homogenised values from cross-validation

% Do the uncertainties we provide make sense?

% Limitations of the model // "problematic regimes"

% Homogenised results in context of the initial results
